# Unexpected Floating-Point Behavior in Conditional Statement

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Julia related to unexpected behavior with floating-point numbers in conditional statements.  The issue arises from the limitations of floating-point precision, leading to incorrect evaluations of conditions involving numbers very close to zero.

## Bug Description

The `myfunction` function is designed to square its input. However, due to how floating-point numbers are represented, comparisons like `x == 0` might not behave as expected when `x` is a floating-point number extremely close to zero but not exactly zero. This can lead to the `elseif` condition not being met, resulting in an unexpected return value.

## Solution

The solution involves using a tolerance for comparing floating-point numbers to zero, instead of direct equality checks. This ensures that numbers within a certain range of zero are treated as zero.
